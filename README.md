# Summary
This repository is meant to hold all personal projects that I've worked on and have them neatly stored in the same place for easy access.

# Browser C11
- Simulation for a browser made for the Data Structures class. Its only requirement was to use a Stack implementation (whether your own or C++ implementation) to 
  create 4 functions from scratch. Makes good practice for Stack ADT usage and input validations.
  
 # DNA-C11
 - Program based on a Stanford project where you'll be given a file with DNA sequences and you have to write a program that can detect a given string pattern to
  "find" who owns that DNA sample. This program specifically required knowledge on a Queue ADT, maps and file streams.

# maxHeap-C11
- Project that had me making a Binary Max Heap using the Linked Nodes data structure instead of an array. It was necessary to understand how linked nodes worked 
  in order to start visualizing how to connect the pointers in a way a Max Heap would.
